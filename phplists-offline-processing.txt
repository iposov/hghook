# script to run PHPlist from commandline. You may need to edit this to make it work
# with your shell environment. The following should work for Bash on Fedora Linux
# but this may vary strongly in other situations. You will need to dig into the
# code to make sure it works for you.

# in commandline mode, access is restricted to users who are listed in the config file
# check README.commandline for more info

# identify the config file for your installation
PHPLIST_PATH=/var/www/lists
CONFIG=$PHPLIST_PATH/config/config.php
INDEX=$PHPLIST_PATH/admin/index.php

# alternatively you can use -c <path to config file> on the commandline

# run the PHPlist index file with all parameters passed to this script
/usr/bin/php $INDEX -c $CONFIG $*
